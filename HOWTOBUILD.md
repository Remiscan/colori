# How to build colori

## JavaScript

To build **colori.js** and **colori.min.js**, you need to have installed:
- [deno](https://deno.land/#installation)

Then, if the ```[auto] bundle colori.js on file change``` task is running, any change to any file in src/ts will trigger a build.
You can manually trigger it by running the "bundle colori.js" task.

## PHP

To build **colori.php**, you need to have installed:
- [deno](https://deno.land/#installation)
- [PHP 8+](https://www.php.net/downloads)

Then, if the ```[auto] bundle colori.php on file change``` task is running, any change to any file in src/php will trigger a build.
You can manually trigger it by running the default task.
