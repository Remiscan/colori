# colori
JavaScript module to convert (between CSS-supported formats) and manipulate colors. Also available in PHP if that's what you use to generate colors server-side.

My main goal with **colori** is to make it easy to use for everyone. You just download the .js or .php file and import it in your code as shown in the documentation.

### How to use

*   [colori.js: JavaScript documentation](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/wiki/Documentation-(JavaScript))
*   [colori.php: PHP documentation](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/wiki/Documentation-(PHP))

The **colori** module itself is fully contained in the **colori.js** or **colori.php** files. There are no dependencies, and you can download these files on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/releases).

All the other files in this repo are part of the source code for the demo / documentation website [remiscan.fr/colori/](https://remiscan.fr/colori/).
