# colori

**colori** is a module to convert (between CSS-supported formats) and manipulate colors. It is available in JavaScript or in PHP.

My main goal with **colori** is to make it easy to use for everyone. You just download the **colori.js** or **colori.php** file – available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/releases) – and import it in your code as shown in the [documentation](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/wiki). There are no dependencies, the module is fully contained in the **colori.js** or **colori.php** file.

**colori**'s main functions are:

  - color conversion: supported formats are RGB (hexadecimal or functional), HSL, HWB, LAB and LCH. Convert any color from any of these formats to any other with ease.
  - color manipulation:
    - blend colors together...
    - ...or unblend them!
    - calculate the contrast between two colors
    - automatically improve the contrast between two colors
    - make beautiful gradients
    - etc.
