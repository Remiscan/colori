# colori
JavaScript module to convert (between CSS-supported formats) and manipulate colors. Also available in PHP if that's what you use to generate colors server-side.

My main goal with **colori** is to make it easy to use for everyone. You just download the .js or .php file and import it in your code as shown in the documentation.

### How to use
