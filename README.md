# colori

**colori** is a module to manipulate colors. It is available in [JavaScript](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/releases/latest/download/colori.min.js) or in [PHP](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori/releases/latest/download/colori.php). Here's what it can do:

  - **color conversion**: supported CSS formats are RGB (hexadecimal or functional), HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH and the color() function (+ OKLAB and OKLCH, but their syntax may change). Convert any color from any of these formats to any other with ease.
  - **color blending**: overlay multiple colors over each other and compute the resulting visible color with alpha blending. Colors can also be *un*blended.
  - **contrast computing**: calculate the contrast between two colors. Automatically modify a color to improve its contrast with another.
  - **gradients**: create beautiful gradients in any supported color space, avoiding the *desaturated zone* of native CSS gradients.
  - **and more**: clamp a color to a color space, compute the distance between two colors...
