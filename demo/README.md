This folder contains the source code for the demo / documentation website [remiscan.fr/colori/](https://remiscan.fr/colori/).

The demo website lets you type a valid color expression in an input field, and automatically converts it into all CSS-supported formats. The interface changes color based on user input.

It also lets you test functions from **colori.js**, like modifying or blending colors, directly in that same input field.
